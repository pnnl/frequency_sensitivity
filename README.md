# `frequency_sensitivity`

Code for the experiments in [Regularized linear convolutional networks inherit
frequency sensitivity from image statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01257)
is currently going through internal review and will be released soon.

For now, we include full tables of training hyperparameters and model accuracies
as supplementary material in `./model_details`.
